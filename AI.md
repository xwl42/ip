## Usage Summary

- **Tool Used**: ChatGPT (OpenAI)
- **Purpose**: Mainly used for generating and refining **Javadoc comments** for classes and methods.

---

## Details

### Increments Supported
- **A-CodeQuality**: Improved Javadoc across tasks, commands and exceptions for better readability and maintainability.

### What Worked
- AI was very effective at:
    - Generating initial Javadoc quickly.
    - Providing standardised formatting and consistent style across the project.
    - Explaining edge cases clearly in documentation.

### What Didn’t Work
- Sometimes AI produced overly verbose or generic comments that had to be simplified.
- Context-specific details (e.g., project-specific terminology) required manual editing.

### Time Savings
- Writing Javadoc manually would have taken significantly longer.
- Using AI reduced documentation time by **~50–60%**, allowing more focus on coding and feature implementation.
